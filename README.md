Facial Attendance System
The Facial Attendance System is a Python-based application that uses face recognition to mark attendance. It leverages the face_recognition library to detect and recognize faces, and then logs the attendance of recognized individuals.

Features
Face Encoding: The system encodes facial features from a set of training images and uses them to recognize individuals in real-time.
Real-time Attendance Marking: When a recognized face is detected, the system logs the attendance with the current timestamp.
Support for Multiple Faces: The system can detect and recognize multiple faces in real-time.
CSV Logging: Attendance is logged in a CSV file, making it easy to integrate with other systems or for further analysis.
Key Files
AttendanceProject.py: This is the main file responsible for capturing video feed, recognizing faces, and marking attendance.
main.py: A test script that demonstrates face recognition using a pair of images.
How to Use
Add training images to the ImagesAttendance directory. The system will use these images to recognize individuals.
Run AttendanceProject.py to start the attendance system.
The system will capture video from the default camera and recognize faces in real-time.
Recognized faces will have their attendance marked in the Attendance.csv file.
